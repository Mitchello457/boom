object_types

This directory contains all of the game object types. Each object in the map
will load their types from their respective type file.

Object types are Lua tables. Each type file should return the object type table.
Invalid type files will raise errors at runtime if they are used by any objects.

Objects have 4 built-in events which are called automatically:
    init (this) : Object constructor. This function is called once an object is added to a group.
                  Note that the constructor will be called before other objects have been loaded;
                  If this object needs to get a reference to another object (EG. by name), that
                  is better handled within the 'ready' event which is only called after every
                  object has been initialized.

                  <this> is the initial state of the object. Any properties specified in Tiled
                  will be present in this table.

    destroy (this) : Object destructor. Called when the object is destroyed.
                     No other events will be called after 'destroy'.

    update (this, dt) : Object update event. Called on every update with the delta time.

    render (this) : Object draw event. Any graphics operations should be here.

Objects can subscribe to additonal events by calling 'object.subscribe(this, evt_name)'.
This should only be performed in the 'init' event. The subscription is automatically destroyed.

Many elements of game objects can be reused. This is the basis of the object component system.
To add a component to an object, an object can call 'object.component(this, component_name, component_params)' in the 'init' event.

To see an example obbject demonstrating the usage of components and custom events, see './example_type.lua'.
